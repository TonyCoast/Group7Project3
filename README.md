### Background
This project was completed for the Data Visualization Bootcamp Project 3. Gather and store data to create a dashboard page with user driven interactions

### The Code 

### Datasets
1. We are analyzing 2013-2022 data from the Bureau of Labor Statitics (bls.gov)
2. We are honing in on three categories:
  a) Alcohol
  b) Dairy & related
  c) Meat, poultry, fish and eggs
3. We are comparing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as well as the Producer Price Index (PPI)
4. We are looking specifically at 3 cities: Chicago, Atlanta & Denver

### Future Opportunities 
* Analyzing stock price data and its relation to CPI & PPI data
* Reviewing data from all major US cities
